Tried homing the FOX phase shifter...it failed with a ""BAD FOX"" status on the EDM panel, all but the first and last times.  Went from 306 -> 274 -> 306 with those scans.

Thanks!

UPDATE: Still can't do a phase scan.  Before, I'd get good, sinusoidal scans, even though the phase would be messed up at the end.  Now, the scans just look random.  Phase (PHAS, not PDES) still trims back to something odd at the end of the scan."

From another CATER(124062(TEC))
Re-energized 25-7 after heater time ins. Station on and stable. Ramped slowly up to 22.2 KV. It appears the DQing firing is moving a little back and forth in time. Raised DQ current from 21.5 to 22.5 amps. This lowered BV by 3 K, but still in tols. Gave station back to MCC. Hope the regulation issues are solved. Passed on issues to swings for monitoring. It appears lowering HV set point by even small amounts stops the ""motorboating"" and wild BV swings we are seeing. 

Since 27-1 has been running well for over an hour, decided to mod AC controllers and replace keep alive supply in 25-7. After shutting down 120 VAC to station, discovered this mod already had its AC controller hots and neutrals swapped through current xducers. Replaced keep alive ps with recently tested spare. Mod now timing in. Lowered reservoir from 6.6 volts to 6.4 volts. Engineer believes thyratron firing thru is cause of ""motorboating"". Will test station after heater time in. --sj"

Time accounting - excessive klystron trips causing downtime for XPP..  As a start, the most obvious culprits are 21-4, 21-5, 24-5, and 24-6.  There are many others that are not too far from being just as bad.  Note that the PIOP error count is under reporting, possibly because they are fast.

MOD 5/1/16 HVS this is a LLRF timing problem with LI22 FIDO. LI22 FIDO RF levels need to be checked. Timing of PDUs which use this FIDO are jumping ~500nS w.r.t. the rest of the timing system, causing these ""apparent"" dropouts.

Beings the BV matches the setpoint of 21.6 kV, the Enerpro board is OK.  Also, the part of the HV regulator board involved in regulating the 21.6 kV is also OK.  The problem is in the part of the HV regulator board associated with sending a DC signal to the PLC analog in module OR a wiring issue (not so likely) OR a faulty PLC analog input (AI2_CH1).

131251,4/5/2016 15:00,2,LI21,71,4,HARDWARE,HW Problem,"Kly Mod 21-7:  HV readback on touch screen approx. 1/4 of set point.  Actual BV matches set point of 21.6KV.  Either readback board (attached to DC filter caps above T20) is bad or PLC requires reprogramming.


comment by p.stiles: 

Beings the BV matches the setpoint of 21.6 kV, the Enerpro board is OK.  Also, the part of the HV regulator board involved in regulating the 21.6 kV is also OK.  The problem is in the part of the HV regulator board associated with sending a DC signal to the PLC analog in module OR a wiring issue (not so likely) OR a faulty PLC analog input (AI2_CH1).
